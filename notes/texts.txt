Block1
What do we aim to solve?
As game developers, we couldn't test our game's performance without manually disconnecting and reconnecting multiple GPUs. 
Even worse, we weren't sure how many people actually do have the hardware to play our game. 
We aim to solve this with our custom infrastructure, where you will be able to test your game on multiple GPUs, CPUs, and RAMs, 
and obtain report of your game's accessibility depending on Steam's Hardware Survey.

Block2
Our game testing service ensures that your game runs flawlessly on all the most popular gaming hardware, 
giving you the confidence to release a game that will satisfy your players and boost your sales.

Block3
We understand that game testing can be time-consuming and expensive, which is why we offer 
an affordable and efficient automated testing service that provides detailed reports and charts 
to help you optimize your game quickly and easily.

Block4
Even if you have a great game, poor performance on popular hardware can cost you a lot of money. 
We want to help you ensure that your game performs well on all types of popular gamerâ€™s hardware.
