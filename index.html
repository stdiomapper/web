				<h2>What do we aim <strong>to solve?</strong></h2>
				<p>As game developers, we couldn't test our game's performance without manually disconnecting and reconnecting multiple GPUs. Even worse, we weren't sure how many people actually do have the hardware to play our game. We aim to solve this with our custom infrastructure, where you will be able to test your game on multiple GPUs, CPUs, and RAMs, and obtain report of your game's accessibility depending on Steam's Hardware Survey. </p>
